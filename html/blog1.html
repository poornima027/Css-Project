    <p>OnePlus has taken a bunch of features from the more expensive OnePlus 7 Pro and put them into the OnePlus 7T, which is the successor to the OnePlus 7. To add to this confusion, the older two models have only been on the market for around four months prior to this launch. While some buyers will love having more features and power, there are others who will be disappointed that this company has raised the price of its base model yet again. 

        The OnePlus 7T offers three rear cameras - a standard 48-megapixel one, a wide-angle one, and a 2X optical zoom one - along with the brand new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, a 90Hz screen, and frosted glass rear panel. These are all premium features, and this phone definitely looks and feels the part, rivalling flagship phones that cost up to twice as much.
        
        You might not like the huge circular camera bump on the rear, and sadly there's no IP rating or wireless charging. There's also still a waterdrop notch cutting into the screen for thefront camera.
        
        Performance is great, especally in games. The cameras are somewhat of a mixed bag, delivering very good results sometimes, but not consistently. This phone also runs Android 10 out of the box, with OnePlus' customised OxygenOS skin. Battery life is good and this phone charges insanely quickly.
        
        New buyers with a budget of Rs. 40,000 will be delighted with the OnePlus 7T but OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro buyers, as well as fans of the brand, might be a little annoyed.</p>
